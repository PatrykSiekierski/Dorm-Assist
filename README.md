# Dorm-Assist - Not finished

<p>Full-stack first contact website for dorm resitents, if they encounter a network problem.</p>
<p>It's not finished project (almost fully functional, some bugs here and there), but I feel like I should just show this repo so not every of my projects will stay hidden in fog for who knows how long. (If there are some comments, that should not see a light, please ignore them...)</p>

<h2>📓 Description</h2>
<p>This project was based on a joke of my roommate, that was talking about a lot of small problems that people have with the internet in the dorm. As I think that this type of website isn't important for wellbeing of the dorm, I believe that it can do for a good project idea. Small, quick, and I can fit a lot of technologies, and problems for good learning ground.</p>
<p>Website include simple user info panels and form where users can describe the problem they are facing. Simple, and straightforward, with pleasant design (at least I hope you like it).</p>
<p>You are an admin, so you can access the admin panel and generate sample users nad reports and test it's functionality.</p>

<h2>📌 Goals</h2>
<p>For this project I want to train a little my design skills and knowledge of different libraries for frontend - react, but more importantly I wanted to increse my knowledge of backend technologies.</p>
<p>Token authentication is really important in most of more advanced projects, so it was my goal to make a simple project, that include it. Aside from that I added reporting option for me to train a little with the databases.</p>
<p>So the final goal was to make a simple, pretty website that have a lot of real life technologies implemented. This way I can learn a lot, while being able to finish this project in relatively short ammount of time, so I can easly fit it with college studies and student activities.</p>

<h2>💻 Technologies</h2>
<p>This project was oriented on working on project that both include front and backend, with a little more concepts like tokens, databases, and different type of users, so it can feel like shomewhat real project.</p>

 <li>Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT (JSON Web Token), REST API</li>
