# Dorm-Assist - Not finished

<p>Full-stack first contact website for dorm resitents, if they encounter a network problem.</p>
<p>It's not finished project, but I feel like I should just show this repo so not every of my projects will stay hidden in fog for who knows how long. (If there are some comments, that should not see a light, please ignore them...)</p>

<h2>ðŸ““ Description</h2>
<p>This project was based on a joke of my roommate, that was talking about a lot of small problems that people have with the internet in the dorm. As I think that this type of website isn't important for wellbeing of the dorm, I believe that it can do for a good project idea. Small, quick, and I can fit a lot of technologies, and problems for good learning ground.</p>
<p>Website include simple user info panels and form where users can describe the problem they are facing. Simple, and straightforward, with pleasant design (I hope).</p>
<p>You can also set the option to be the admin of this website, and look up the problems in the admin panel, check the users, and manage it.</p>
<p>Unfortunetelly right now there are no real posibilities to set yourself roles (yet), but after some time I will give this option.</p>

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Goals</h2>
<p>For this project I want to train a little my design skills and knowledge of different libraries for frontend - react, but more importantly I wanted to increse my knowledge of backend technologies.</p>
<p>Token authentication is really important in most of more advanced projects, so it was my goal to make a simple project, that include it. Aside from that I added reporting option for me to train a little with the databases.</p>
<p>So the final goal was to make a simple, pretty website that have a lot of real life technologies implemented. This way I can learn a lot, while being able to finish this project in relatively short ammount of time, so I can easly fit it with college studies and student activities.</p>

<h2>ðŸ’» Technologies</h2>
<p>This project was oriented on working on project that both include front and backend, with a little more concepts like tokens, databases, and different type of users, so it can feel like shomewhat real project.</p>
<p>I learned and trained a lot of skills, here are more important ones (keywords): </p>
<ul>
 <li>Frontend: React, SCSS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
 <li>Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT (JSON Web Token), REST API</li>
 <li>Database: MySQL</li>
 <li>Others: Postman (for testing APIs), GitHub for version control</li>
</ul>
<p>Also for woth mentioning skills I learned: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Token authentication (jwt)</li>
 <li>Role-based access control (RBAC)</li>
 <li>Password hashing</li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸŽ® Demo</h2>
<p>Demo version will be a separate website, where you can test the website from perspective of visiter, user or admin.</p>
<p>Unfortunetelly for now you can only download and load this project yourself, because I don't plan on making it a website, when it's half coocked. I have a lot of things to do, so the project hava kinda slow progress for now, but it should be finished in a month or two if college session goes well.</p>
